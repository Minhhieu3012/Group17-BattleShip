# This folder is named 'client-network' (with a hyphen) so it cannot be imported as a normal package.
# Import modules by appending this folder to sys.path, e.g.:
#   import sys, os
#   sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'client-network'))
#   from network_client import start_network, get_state
